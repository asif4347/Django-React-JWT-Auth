<h1>Django REST Framework JWT Authentication</h1>
<br/>
This is a very broad generalization of the methodology employed by JSON Web Tokens (JWTs for short). JWTs are regarded as the gold standard in authentication right now, so that’s what we Used here. 
<br/><br/>Tokens are key-value pairs which usually live in the local storage of your browser. In this regard they are similar to cookies, token authorization is stateless, meaning there’s no record kept on the server of which users are logged in, how many tokens have been issued etc. Instead, tokens are generated by means of a complex encryption process which, when reversed and decrypted, authenticates the user.

<br/><br/>Following python packages are used for creating REST APIs with token auth
